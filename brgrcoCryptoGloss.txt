Agenda For Future Classes (Unanswered/ More advanced questions) 
• How do you put your crypto into a liquidity pool? 
• What are other ways of passively earning besides staking? 
• And what is some advice for those who can only stake small amounts (around 25-80) to see the best return? 
• Charts & info, like on dextools, for example 
• I'd like to know the best way to avoid or at last reduce high gas fees when buying coins with eth 
• I’m particularly interested in learning more about stack investments, lending and staking and the various methods people use. 
• I am new to crypto and learning how to research and buy…uniswap, pancakeswap, Metamask, etc. 
• Of all the options, how do I make a living from it? o 	Cashflow or sell  
• How do I take it to the professional and/or next level? 
• Relative noob with many questions, interested in where to research, what kind of information should I look for & how to use that info; wallet recommendations & pros & cons of the recommendations; understanding the info on a swap, like uniswap or similar; burn & earn % (I'm thinking this percentage is what you will not receive when you think you purchased a certain amount of token/coin).
